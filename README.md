You can create footnote references that are short[^1] or long.[^2]
You can also create them inline.^[which may be easier,
since you don't need to pick an identifier and move down to type the note]
The footnotes are automatically numbered at the bottom of your note,
but you'll need to manually number your superscripts.
Make sure to count your variable[^variable] footnotes.[^5]

[^1]: Here's a footnote.
[^2]: Hereâ€™s a footnote with multiple blocks.

```
Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they belong to the previous footnote.

    { eight spaces for some code }

The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
line. In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
multi-paragraph list items.
```

This paragraph wonâ€™t be part of the footnote, because it
isnâ€™t indented.

[^variable]: The variable footnote is the fourth footnote.
[^5]: This is the fifth footnote.
